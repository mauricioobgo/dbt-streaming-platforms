##  Project Name: Streaming Data Pipeline

## Overview: The goal of this project is to create a data pipeline that extracts data from a Postgres database and various streaming platform APIs, transform it, and then load it into a data warehouse for further analysis.

# Architecture:

*Extraction:* Data is extracted from a Postgres database that contains user data and viewing behavior data. The streaming platform APIs are used to extract data on titles, genres, and other metadata.

*Transformation:* dbt Cloud is used to transform the data. Data is cleaned, normalized, and enriched using dbt models. dbt Cloud automatically executes the models on a schedule or whenever new data is available, ensuring that the data is always up-to-date and ready for analysis.

*Loading:* The transformed data is then loaded into a data warehouse such as Snowflake or Redshift. The data warehouse can be queried using SQL, allowing analysts to gain insights into user behavior, popular titles, and other key metrics.

*Analysis:* The data can be analyzed using BI tools like Tableau, Looker, or PowerBI. Analysts can create reports, dashboards, and visualizations to communicate insights to stakeholders.

# Key Benefits:

Automated Data Pipelines: The use of dbt Cloud allows for the creation of automated data pipelines that automatically transform and load data into a data warehouse. This reduces the need for manual intervention and ensures that the data is always up-to-date.

Scalable: The use of cloud-based services such as dbt Cloud and a data warehouse like Snowflake or Redshift allows for the creation of a highly scalable data pipeline that can handle large volumes of data.

Improved Data Quality: dbt Cloud's automated data transformation ensures that data is cleaned, normalized, and enriched, resulting in improved data quality.

Real-time Data: The use of streaming platform APIs allows for the extraction of real-time data, enabling analysts to gain insights into user behavior as it happens.

Conclusion:

The Streaming Data Pipeline project is an example of how dbt Cloud can be used to create a scalable, automated data pipeline that transforms and loads data into a data warehouse for further analysis. The use of streaming platform APIs and a cloud-based data warehouse allows for the extraction and analysis of real-time data, providing insights into user behavior, popular titles, and other key metrics.
